## What is this?
Mostly got tired of needing to know links to software, but
didn't want to archive older versions of stuff from the
endpoints they're coming from.

(Admittedly, this is mostly to make life at work easier.)

## Contributing
I don't have contributing guidelines laid out at this time,
but if you want to contribute *now*: just try and match
what is already present in this repository.

## Current Shortlinks
Note: "latest" doesn't always guarantee latest. Submit a PR
if a link needs to be updated.
