## What is this?

Mostly got tired of needing to know links to software, but
didn't want to archive older versions of stuff from the
endpoints they're coming from. Also searching up the same
thing over and over and over gets really, really old.

(Admittedly, this is mostly to make life at work easier.)

## Contributing

I don't have contributing guidelines laid out at this time,
but if you want to contribute *now*: just try and match
what is already present in this repository.
